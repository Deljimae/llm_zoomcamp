# llm_zoomcamp## 🛠️ Environment Setup & API Integration

Set up the environment for the [LLM Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp) course and explored API integrations.

### ✅ Steps Completed

- Installed required dependencies and initialized the project.
- Configured **Groq API** successfully for LLM interaction.
- OpenAI integration **did not work** due to cost
- I also couldn't use Gemini because of the limits 

### 🔄 Current Configuration

Using **Groq API** for all model interaction exercises in this repository.

> 💡 Tip: If you accidentally commit secrets (like an API key), follow [GitHub's push protection guide](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/working-with-secret-scanning-and-push-protection) to resolve and remove them properly.
